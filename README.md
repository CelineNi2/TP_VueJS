# VueJS Practical work - Erwin MARTIN & CÃ©line NI

This Git repository contains the Automacorp frontend developped for a programming course.
The goal was to implement the frontend of an application managing rooms and windows.
All of this can, for example, serve as a simulation to understand how to efficiently use energy during winters.

This frontend is powered by :
- Vue.js
- Vite
- Bootstrap
- Axios

## Requirements

This frontend has been developped using Node.js v18.17.1 and Vite v.4.5.0, so be sure to have them installed if it doesn't work at first.

This frontend works using an already deployed backend on CleverCloud [here](http://automacorp-erwin-martin.cleverapps.io/).

If you want to, you can also download the backend [here](http://github.com/erwinmartin06/automacorp), run it locally and updating your frontend src/config.js document to connect your backend (for example http://localhost:8080 if your application is running on the 8080 port).


## Installation

Finally, to compile and hot-reload for development, use

```sh
npm run build
```
